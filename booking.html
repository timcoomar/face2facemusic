<h2>Booking a Face2Face Concert</h2>
<p>To take you through the process of booking and organising a F2F concert, we've made life easy by breaking down the process, step by step, so here goes.</p>
<p><strong>TO DOWNLOAD THE BOOKING FORM SCROLL DOWN TO THE END OF THIS EXPLANATION</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>STEP 1 - THE TARGET AUDIENCE:</h3>
<p>Identify your target audience. Will the concert be aimed at the local community, a specific organisation or charity, a mainly youth oriented gathering or a general concert by invitation? Your target audience also helps us to put together the right programme</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>STEP 2 - THE CHOSEN VENUE:</h3>
<p>Is the venue big enough to stage a concert with 9 musicians, a PA team of 4 and all the audience to make it viable? Also, is there sufficient space for parking and unloading all the PA gear? Are there any access issues we may need to consider? Depending on the distance and team availability, we sometimes undertake a recce of the venue to identify any issues in advance. Please ensure that accurate directions are given to our contact person in good time. Will there be enough chairs/seating arrangements for the expected number you aim to cater for? Are there any health and safety issues we may need to consider at the chosen venue? Is the venue /organising party adequately covered for public liability insurance?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>STEP 3 - THE ORGANISING TEAM:</h3>
<p>Do you have a well organised team to carry forward the praying, planning, catering and organising for the concert? Who is you immediate contact person where all communication can be channelled through?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>STEP 4 - THE PUBLICITY:</h3>
<p>As part of our commitment to making your event a success, we have a standard poster design, matching A4/A5 flyers and tickets, which we can customise for your use in advertising and publicising the concert. You will need to print these from the artwork we supply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>STEP 5 - THE PRAYER:</h3>
<p>We are strong believers in the power of prayer. It is vitally important that you set up a prayer team, or praying people to pray through all the stages of the planning, right up to the day of the concert. Our experience is that God truly honours this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>STEP 6 - THE FINANCES:</h3>
<p>Face2Face is a gospel centred musical ministry and as such, none of the team is paid a salary or take any money out of the ministry. All our personal time, resources (and in most cases), our expenses, are all donated to the ministry free of charge for the glory of GOD. We do however charge a set fee for each concert and the funds are used to support the various charities we work with in Russia and other parts of the world. The Russian charity work is funded by the ???Twin Towns Fund???. From time to time we need to upgrade equipment and also pay for the necessary expenses we may incur in running this ministry. This is funded from the general fund. Please discuss this aspect with either Phyllida on??01727 869798??or Alison on??01923 449259.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li>
<h3>STEP 7 - PAYMENT OF THE DEPOSIT:</h3>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When everything has been discussed and agreed, we would send you the contract to be signed and returned, together with the 50% deposit fee. Please note that all the musicians have made a commitment to serve you/the organiser and as such may have given up paying work to make themselves available. Because of this, the deposit in NON REFUNDABLE.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>STEP 8 - LOOKING AFTER THE F2F TEAM:</h3>
<p>Typically, a concert can begin with the PA team setting up their equipment starting from around 10.00 am - 11.00 am in the morning with rehearsals starting at 2.00 pm. After rehearsals, the entire F2F team will need feeding at around 6.00 pm. One or two members do have some specific dietary requirements which we will let you know about in due course. Please also ensure that there is adequate facilities for the team to change and leave any belongings in a safe and secure place. The concert is usually advertised for 7.00 pm and will start at 7.30 pm and finish at around 9.30 pm. Tea/coffee and biscuits should be made available for the team at the start and during the afternoon. Also bottles of water should be supplied for the team.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li>
<h3>STEP 9 - THE REHEARSAL:</h3>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though the Face2Face team are all seasoned professionals, ample rehearsal time is essential for the concert to be a total success, as each venue can pose challenges in terms of sound and audience positioning etc. We would also ask those who do the organising to kindly instruct any helpers etc to maintain a ???no noise??? policy during rehearsal times. We also like to spend a bit of time in prayer as part of our rehearsal time.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li>
<h3>STEP 10 - THE CONCERT SETTING:</h3>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is essential that the organisers are realistic about the choice of venue and setting for the concert. People are paying for an evening of good entertainment and will want to enjoy the music in a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere. Please do ensure that the venue is suitable and that there is ample access for vehicles, set up and space for all the Face2Face musicians to perform in. It is customary to have a short food/refreshment break half way through the concert. This can take the form of light finger food with drinks, snacks or even desserts. Please discuss this aspect with one of the F2F contacts. The ideal concert setting should be in a relaxed ???caf?? style??? environment where the audience is seated around tables and not restricted in any way. However, we do appreciate that this arrangement may not always work if the hall/venue has established seating like theatre style seating or church seating. If lighting is available, we would appreciate access to the lighting rig and to be able to utilise this facility on the night. All this can be ironed out when making contact with us.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li>
<h3>STEP 11 - PAYMENT ON THE NIGHT:</h3>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please make sure the correct payment (balance 50% of the fee) is made available by your treasurer for payment on the night (not to be posted after the event please).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>STEP 12 - PLEASE CALL US:</h3>
<p>The above 11 steps are meant as a quick guide to the whole process, but we would ask you to give us a call in order to discuss your specific vision and expectations more thoroughly. We have staged and performed many concerts for a variety of groups and audiences and have a lot of experience in advising and guiding you through the process. Our primary aim is for the message of the love of GOD to shine through everything that we do and say and for GOD to get all the glory on the evening.</p>
